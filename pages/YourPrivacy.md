# Beyond Locks and Cameras: Securing the Digital Gateway to Your Home

*Securing our homes has become more sophisticated than ever. One does not have to invest as much as you had to do for 15 years. —equipping them with state-of-the-art locks, surveillance cameras, protective dogs, and advanced security systems—it's paradoxical how one critical component often remains neglected: our digital gateway. Despite these extensive physical security measures, many of us overlook the heart of our home's digital domain: the router. Surprisingly, it's not uncommon for a router to remain unchanged for 5 to 7 years or even older than that, operating with overly simplistic passwords or with Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) enabled, laying out a welcome mat for digital intruders. A simple YouTube search and you are good to go as a total newbie.*

*The very truth: In today's world, security transcends the physical barriers of doors and walls. 
The digital sphere within our homes demands equal, if not **more**, attention. Poor digital security practices turn our mics, into ears, our cameras into eyes and our network storages into an unwelcoming insight into our private lives.* 

**So, the question arises:** if you wouldn't openly invite a stranger into your home to eavesdrop on your conversations, why would you leave your digital door wide open?

Security's a big deal for me—I think you've picked up on that by now. My home's wrapped in a modest 1.70m fence, peppered with security cameras, and bolstered by top-notch indoor and outdoor security systems, not to mention the modern locks on the doors. But that's not all. Sure, I've got the imposing Dobermann, a classic choice for home protection. Yet, the real guardian of the fortress? My cat. A seemingly fluffy creature, yet an unmatched sentinel in its own right.

Inside, with the peace of mind these layers of security provide, I can lose myself in a movie, uninterrupted, save for the occasional alert letting me know someone's wandering too close for comfort.

Peering out, I watch life unfold on the street beyond my secured perimeter. People walking their dogs, some hastening by, others pausing for a smoke break right outside my fence, engrossed in their phones. It's an everyday scene, set against the backdrop of my carefully curated security setup.

But what if we looked at this scenario from another angle?

Take, for instance, the OnePlus 7T—a phone that, thanks to companies like Refurbed, can be snagged for a price range between 250 to 370 euros. This isn't just any smartphone. With a bit of tweaking, specifically by installing something known as Nethunter, it transforms into a potent pen-testing tool that's as mobile as you are.

Why the OnePlus 7T, you might ask? Beyond its sleek design and robust performance, it harbors a chip capable of supporting 'monitor mode'. This is a hacker's dream, allowing for the monitoring and capturing of data packets invisibly floating through the air around us. It's this feature that elevates the OnePlus 7T from a mere communication device to a stealthy cybersecurity tool, enabling ethical hackers to test and secure networks from the palm of their hand.

With everything in place, the routine dog walk transforms into an opportunity to discreetly assess the security of nearby Wi-Fi networks. The smartphone in my pocket is no longer just a device for calls and texts; it's a powerful tool that scans the digital airwaves, evaluating the strength and vulnerabilities of the invisible networks we pass by.

*Now, let's sprinkle a dash of fantasy into this narrative. Picture a scenario reminiscent of those from the Swedish TV series "Granfejden," where neighbor disputes escalate to the point of absurdity, with conflicts over trivial matters leading to outright shootouts. These feuds, though seemingly ridiculous, underline a stark reality: the ease with which digital skirmishes can unfold in our interconnected world.*

Imagine if those neighborly disagreements weren't confined to physical altercations or heated exchanges but extended into the digital realm. In such a scenario, the tools for digital warfare, like the ones tucked away in my pocket, become instruments that could be wielded with little to no effort. A disgruntled neighbor, fueled by the kind of pettiness seen in "Granfejden," could easily turn to cyber attacks. With just a few taps on a smartphone, they could attempt to infiltrate your Wi-Fi network, snoop on your online activities, or even disrupt your home's smart devices.

The simplicity and accessibility of these hacking tools mean that, in the hands of someone with a vendetta, even the most mundane disagreements could escalate into a full-blown digital feud. It's a thought-provoking twist on the concept of neighborly disputes, illustrating not just the evolution of conflict in our modern, tech-savvy society but also the ever-present need to secure our digital doorsteps against potential threats, no matter how small or seemingly silly they might appear.
