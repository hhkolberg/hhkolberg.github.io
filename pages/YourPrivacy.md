# Beyond Locks and Cameras: Securing the Digital Gateway to Your Home

*Securing our homes has become more sophisticated than ever. One does not have to invest as much as you had to do for 15 years. —equipping them with state-of-the-art locks, surveillance cameras, protective dogs, and advanced security systems—it's paradoxical how one critical component often remains neglected: our digital gateway. Despite these extensive physical security measures, many of us overlook the heart of our home's digital domain: the router. Surprisingly, it's not uncommon for a router to remain unchanged for 5 to 7 years or even older than that, operating with overly simplistic passwords or with Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) enabled, laying out a welcome mat for digital intruders. A simple YouTube search and you are good to go as a total newbie.*

*The very truth: In today's world, security transcends the physical barriers of doors and walls. 
The digital sphere within our homes demands equal, if not **more**, attention. Poor digital security practices turn our mics, into ears, our cameras into eyes and our network storages into an unwelcoming insight into our private lives.* 

**So, the question arises:** if you wouldn't openly invite a stranger into your home to eavesdrop on your conversations, why would you leave your digital door wide open?

Security's a big deal for me—I think you've picked up on that by now. My home's wrapped in a modest 1.70m fence, peppered with security cameras, and bolstered by top-notch indoor and outdoor security systems, not to mention the modern locks on the doors. But that's not all. Sure, I've got the imposing Dobermann, a classic choice for home protection. Yet, the real guardian of the fortress? My cat. A seemingly fluffy creature, yet an unmatched sentinel in its own right.

Inside, with the peace of mind these layers of security provide, I can lose myself in a movie, uninterrupted, save for the occasional alert letting me know someone's wandering too close for comfort.

Peering out, I watch life unfold on the street beyond my secured perimeter. People walking their dogs, some hastening by, others pausing for a smoke break right outside my fence, engrossed in their phones. It's an everyday scene, set against the backdrop of my carefully curated security setup.

But what if we looked at this scenario from another angle?

**The unsusceptible enemy on the street**

Take, for instance, the OnePlus 7T—a phone that, thanks to companies like Refurbed, can be snagged for a price range between 250 to 370 euros. This isn't just any smartphone. With a bit of tweaking, specifically by installing something known as Nethunter, it transforms into a potent pen-testing tool that's as mobile as you are.

Why the **OnePlus 7T**, you might ask? Beyond its sleek design and robust performance, it harbors a chip capable of supporting 'monitor mode'. This is a hacker's dream, allowing for the monitoring and capturing of data packets invisibly floating through the air around us. It's this feature that elevates the **OnePlus 7T** from a mere communication device to a stealthy cybersecurity tool, enabling ethical hackers to test and secure networks from the palm of their hand.

With everything in place, the routine dog walk transforms into an opportunity to discreetly assess the security of nearby Wi-Fi networks. The smartphone in my pocket is no longer just a device for calls and texts; it's a powerful tool that scans the digital airwaves, evaluating the strength and vulnerabilities of the invisible networks we pass by.

**The Story**

*Now, let's sprinkle a dash of fantasy into this narrative. Picture a scenario reminiscent of those from the Swedish TV series "Granfejden," where neighbor disputes escalate to the point of absurdity, with conflicts over trivial matters leading to outright shootouts. These feuds, though seemingly ridiculous, underline a stark reality: the ease with which digital skirmishes can unfold in our interconnected world.* *Imagine if those neighborly disagreements weren't confined to physical altercations or heated exchanges but extended into the digital realm. In such a scenario, the tools for digital warfare, like the ones tucked away in my pocket, become instruments that could be wielded with little to no effort. A disgruntled neighbor, fueled by the kind of pettiness seen in "Granfejden," could easily turn to cyber attacks. With just a few taps on a smartphone, they could attempt to infiltrate your Wi-Fi network, snoop on your online activities, or even disrupt your home's smart devices.*

The simplicity and accessibility of these hacking tools mean that, in the hands of someone with a vendetta, even the most mundane disagreements could escalate into a full-blown digital feud. It's a thought-provoking twist on the concept of neighborly disputes, illustrating not just the evolution of conflict in our modern, tech-savvy society but also the ever-present need to secure our digital doorsteps against potential threats, no matter how small or seemingly silly they might appear.

As my casual stroll with the dog serves as a façade for a more clandestine operation, the preliminary scan of the neighborhood Wi-Fi networks reveals much with little effort. The mere observation of network names and router brands provides a wealth of information, betraying a lack of cybersecurity awareness among the inhabitants. The glaring indicator of vulnerability, however, is the enabled WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) feature, coupled with the presence of connected clients. These signs point to an easily accessible target for those with nefarious intentions, marking the first step in identifying potential weaknesses in the digital defenses of my surroundings.

**Elevating the Strategy**

Recognizing the limitations posed by a mere 20 dB connection strength, the next phase of this digital reconnaissance requires a more sophisticated approach. To enhance my capabilities, I've procured a specialized tool from **ALFA Network Inc**—the AWUS036ACH v.2 adapter. This piece of equipment is not just any network adapter; it's like a portal to expanded possibilities, **perfectly** complementing my arsenal of cybersecurity tools.

What sets the AWUS036ACH v.2 apart is its compatibility with Kali Linux and, by extension, Nethunter. This compatibility ensures seamless integration with my current setup, offering the much-coveted monitor mode. This mode is pivotal for conducting passive surveillance of Wi-Fi traffic, capturing packets without connecting to the network—a crucial capability for assessing vulnerabilities without alerting the network's users.

----------

**The Importance of Precision**

Installing the drivers for the AWUS036ACH v.2 is a straightforward process, yet it demands attention to detail. The selection of the correct driver is critical; a misstep here could not only impair the adapter's performance but significantly reduce the connection strength. Thus, the process is approached with the attention it deserves, ensuring that the potential of this powerful tool is fully realized.

With the adapter ready and the drivers correctly installed, the stage is set for a deeper dive into the digital landscape of my target. The goal remains clear: to understand and expose the vulnerabilities that lie hidden within the seemingly secure networks that surround us but with one specific target in mind. As the line between physical and digital security blurs, the importance of safeguarding our digital domains becomes ever more apparent, underscoring the necessity of vigilance in an increasingly connected world.

**The "Choose and do something else approach"**


Positioned discreetly outside the target's perimeter, the scene is set for an operation that epitomizes the essence of covert activity. With a cigarette in hand, I initiate **Wifite**—a tool designed for the automated penetration testing of Wi-Fi networks. It's an operation that unfolds silently, nestled within the confines of my jacket where the **ALFA adapter**, a crucial piece of this digital puzzle, lies hidden.

The ordinary act of smoking serves as the perfect cover, an innocuous activity masking the complex processes at play. It's during this moment of perceived vulnerability that the target's owner emerges, drawn out by the sight of my dog. Engaging in casual conversation, we exchange pleasantries, all the while unbeknownst to them, the very fabric of their digital security is being scrutinized and potentially compromised by the device in my pocket.

**Wifite** operates with a simplicity that belies its potency. Its automated approach allows for a "set it and forget it" operation, enabling me to divert my full attention to the neighbor. This interaction, genuine on the surface, is underpinned by a starkly contrasting reality. My smartphone, leveraging the power of the ALFA adapter, diligently works through the Wi-Fi network's defenses.

The brilliance of **Wifite** lies in its ability to conduct these operations autonomously, embodying the "choose and do something else" philosophy. In a scenario that toes the line between fiction and potential reality, this approach allows for a seamless integration of hacking activities into the mundanities of everyday life. Should the network's breach become apparent and alarms raised, my outward role in the conversation affords me plausible deniability. Shock and surprise would be my genuine reactions, mirrored in the face of the individual I'm conversing with, effectively concealing my involvement.
