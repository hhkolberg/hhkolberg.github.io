# Reporting & Post-Test
- How do you structure your penetration testing reports to ensure they are actionable for both technical and non-technical stakeholders?
- What steps do you take after a penetration test is concluded?
- How do you handle sensitive information discovered during a penetration test?
- It's crucial to handle sensitive information with utmost confidentiality. Data discovered during tests should be encrypted, stored securely, and only shared with authorized personnel. After the test, all sensitive information must be securely destroyed or returned to the client, as per the agreement.
- How do you measure the success of a penetration test?
- Success can be measured by the number and severity of vulnerabilities uncovered, the insights gained into the security posture of the target, and the actionable recommendations provided. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance the organization's security, so success is also measured by the client's ability to address and mitigate identified risks effectively.
