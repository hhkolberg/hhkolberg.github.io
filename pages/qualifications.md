**Goal:** Complete **over 50 machines** to solidify your understanding and readiness for professional penetration testing tasks.

# Advanced Preparation for OSCP Exam

- Enroll in the OSCP Exam

**Complete Topic Exercises:** Before diving into the exam, make sure to finish all the exercises provided in the OSCP material. Completing these exercises can earn you an additional 10 points, which can be crucial if you're on the cusp of passing the exam.

**Tackle Advanced Topics with Caution**

## AV Evasion and Exploit Development: 
While these topics are essential, *they are less frequently tested in the OSCP Pen-200 exam* and are **more** relevant for the Pen-300 exam. Focus on these areas but remember the core exam objectives.
- Challenge Yourself with Hard Rooms on TryHackMe

**Push Your Limits:** Engaging with harder rooms on TryHackMe not only tests your skills but also prepares you for the unexpected challenges of the OSCP exam.
Use Walkthroughs Wisely: Refer to walkthroughs when necessary, but aim to learn something new each time. This approach ensures that your skills continuously improve, adding new techniques to your arsenal.

## Key Strategies for Success
**Focus on Learning:** 
The goal is to expand your knowledge and skill set, not just to complete tasks. Each challenge should contribute to your understanding and capabilities.

**Prepare for the Practical:** OSCP is heavily practical. Ensure that your study and practice focus on hands-on skills that directly apply to real-world scenarios you'll encounter during the exam.
Remember, the journey to OSCP certification is as much about the knowledge and skills you acquire as it is about passing the exam. Keep challenging yourself, stay curious, and don't shy away from difficult tasks. Your growth through these stages will make you not just ready for the OSCP but a more competent cybersecurity professional overall.
