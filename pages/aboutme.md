# AboutMe
*I am a dedicated enthusiast with a lifelong fascination for computers, having immersed myself in their intricacies since well before the fall of the Berlin Wall. Currently residing with my family in the picturesque southern region of Sweden, I find immense joy in delving into emerging technologies and embracing novel challenges. Alongside my passion for technology, I harbor a deep-seated interest in cybersecurity, engaging actively in both defensive (blue team) and offensive (red team) exercises. This platform serves as a repository for my expertise, musings, and insights that I eagerly extend to a global audience.*
