# AboutMe
*A passionated nerd who has been tinkering with computers since before the Berlin wall fell. I live with my family in the beautiful south of Sweden, where 
I enjoy exploring new technologies and challenges. Cyber security is my second love, and I enjoy both blue and red teaming activities. 
Here you can find some of my skills, thoughts and knowledge that I want to share with the world.*


*Thanks for visiting!*
